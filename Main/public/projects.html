                <u>Description:</u> COVID-19 data tracking website and Discord bot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u>Background:</u> While chatting on the FBLA Discord server, I was contacted by one of the
                administrators there, named "Megasteel", who was working on collecting COVID-19 data and
                compiling it into a spreadsheet. Previously, he had been manually finding data on various
                sites for every single state, but this was terribly inefficient. His request: make a web
                scraper that would collect data from various sites and enter it into a spreadsheet. We
                found another person to help, a person named "gido" from the Cyberpatriot Discord server,
                and made a group chat where we began discussing the project.
                <br>
                Our initial plan was to scrape the data from sites that we had chosen ourselves, like the New
                York Times, using Google Sheets functions that were supposedly able to retrieve and parse HTML.
                However, after hours of struggling, we concluded that this would not work since the page format
                was very hard to traverse. I had also attempted using a Python script to scrape, since Python has
                numerous well-known scraping libraries, but ended up giving up on this plan as well. Now, we
                were back to the drawing board. Our next idea was to find an API that had data on COVID-19. Now
                that we were looking for API data, however, we decided to look for even more reliable and detailed
                data. I happened to stumble upon a John Hopkins University API hosted by a GIS software company
                known as Esri, known for their interactive GIS dashboards made through ArcGIS. This API was
                reliable, coming from JHU, and was even more detailed, giving us access to county-level data
                which was updated multiple times a day.
                <br>
                We decided to make a Discord bot (CovidBot19) which users could use to get updates on the pandemic
                situation.
