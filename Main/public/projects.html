          <u>Background:</u> The Science Olympiad event WiFi Lab requires competitors to
          build an antenna which can transmit WiFi signals from a router to a computer. I
          found it cumbersome having to use a computer to test my antenna from large
          distances, so I decided to create this Android app which allows me to gather data
          on my antenna on my phone and quickly export it to a .txt or .csv file for
          further processing and analysis.

        <p>
          <u>Description:</u> COVID-19 data tracking website and Discord bot.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Background:</u> While chatting on the FBLA Discord server, I was contacted by one of the
          administrators there, named "Megasteel", who was working on collecting COVID-19 data and
          compiling it into a spreadsheet. Previously, he had been manually finding data on various
          sites for every single state, but this was terribly inefficient. His request: make a web
          scraper that would collect data from various sites and enter it into a spreadsheet. We
          found another person to help, a person named "gido" from the Cyberpatriot Discord server,
          and made a group chat where we began discussing the project.
          <br>
          Our initial plan was to scrape the data from sites that we had chosen ourselves, like the New
          York Times, using Google Sheets functions that were supposedly able to retrieve and parse HTML.
          However, after hours of struggling, we concluded that this would not work since the page format
          was very hard to traverse. I had also attempted using a Python script to scrape, since Python has
          numerous well-known scraping libraries, but ended up giving up on this plan as well. Now, we
          were back to the drawing board. Our next idea was to find an API that had data on COVID-19. Now
          that we were looking for API data, however, we decided to look for even more reliable and detailed
          data. I happened to stumble upon a John Hopkins University API hosted by a GIS software company
          known as Esri, known for their interactive GIS dashboards made through ArcGIS. This API was
          reliable, coming from JHU, and was even more detailed, giving us access to county-level data
          which was updated multiple times a day.
          <br>
          We decided to make a Discord bot (CovidBot19) which users could use to get updates on the pandemic
          situation.

        <p>
          <u>Background:</u> In the Scioly.org Discord Server which I am an active member of,
          I met someone with the username Fish. With one of the server administrators being
          named Bear, we all had a running joke that Bear would "eat" Fish whenever she
          appeared in the chat. One evening in 10th grade, I was bored and decided to turn
          this into a game. With nothing better to do, I managed to finish the entire game
          that night, only revising to add a couple extra features and fixes later on.

          <u>Background:</u> After watching 3Blue1Brown's videos on error correction, I was
          absolutely captivated by the magic of the code and thought it would be fun to do
          more just like these, so of course I coded this website to infinitely generate
          Hamming(16,11) codes.
